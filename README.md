The folder HALibrary contains many known examples of finite dimensional C*-(weak) Hopf algebras. 
The package file HATools.wl contains important tools for Hopf algebra computations. 
The package file TensorTools.wl contains tools for basic tensor network maniputations used in the paper. 
The package file HAQCATools.wl contains tools that  automatically construct all the tensors in Eq.(2), 
as well as tools to exactly compute physical quantities in the quench dynamics starting from any initial product state. 
The notebook file FibonacciQCA.nb provides a basic example, where we compute the quench dynamics of the Fibonacci model in Sec.V,
reproduce all the figures in Sec.V.C, and also numerically verifies the finite system revival time in Sec.V.D.
